============================

# About
This is very small sample project showing how to create custom geometry for SceneKit. The generated geometry is a cube with proper surface normals. The cube is put in a simple scene with a single spot light. Everything of interest for the geometry creation is inside `CustomGeometryView.m` under the big comment “Custom geometry starts here ...“.
